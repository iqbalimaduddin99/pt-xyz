Here, I will explain the Git Flow workflow of the branch that I created. 
The first branch that I created was the master branch first as the main branch. 
After that, I created a develop branch taken from the master branch which was used to collect all changes from the developers. 
Developers who want to work on new features will create a feature branch taken from develop.

If the feature created by the developer is complete, the developer will merge it first to the staging branch for testing. 
If it is fixed, then create a pull request from the feature branch to develop. 
After that, pull request again from develop to master to be released to production.

The staging branch itself is not used for pull requests or pulled to other branches because it is only used for testing.
